  ## Description

  An application that uses the third-party API, OpenWeather, to retrieve weather data for cities and displays the weather (weather icon, temperature, wind speed humidity) of the current day and the weather for the five following days. It also uses dayjs to correctly show the current day and future 5 days.

  ## Installation

  npm i, node index.js

  ## Usage

  Search for a city in the search box, the current weather and the future weather for the next 5 days will be displayed with the date, weather icon, temperature, wind speed and humidity. The city will be saved in local storage and will show underneath the search box, this area is the history search where the user can select a city that has already been searched.
